First repo found with the following request on the explore / search github page :

 ```game created:[2012-10-01 TO 2012-10-30]  size:[100 TO 500]   followers:[1 TO 10]   followers:[0 TO 10] language:python```

What I do :
 - find a project in github (I adapt the search request)
 - clone it on codehacktivism organization
 - checkout the project
 - do some changes (perhaps something better or cleaner)
 - git push
 - do a pull request

All steps are timeboxed.

My last timebox :
step 1 (5 minutes) : find a project
step 2 (15 minutes) : test project and read the source code
step 3 (30 minutes) : try to do something
extra time (10 minutes) : finish the stuff and PR

Pull Request on command line :

 - Install hub 
 - hub pull-request -b <user>:<branch> -h <my_user>:<my_branch>
